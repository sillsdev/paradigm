	The conceptually significant subroutine structure is as follows. Other subroutine calls not listed here are for output or for general housekeeping.
C Main procedure
	i Initialize
		B Clear buffers
		H Open output
		I Find which morphemes to analyze
		J Find which processes to use
	f Read in forms
		r Read one data line
		L Look up a morpheme and build tables
			n Test if new
			p Add to list
		M Print the morpheme list
	o Positional analysis
		> Analyze predecessors
			1 Flag assigned columns
		< Analyze successors
			2 Flag assigned rows
	m Distinct sets
		V Fill the union matrix
			w Complement the union vector
		Z Distinct sets
			Y Hidden complete sets
		R Form a reduced matrix
			T Eliminate columns
	s Component subgraph specifications
		K Look for a zero vector
		W Count the weight of each column
		F Find the lowest column sum
		j Print specifications for that column
